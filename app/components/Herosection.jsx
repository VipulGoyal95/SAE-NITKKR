    about: "Team Accelerons Electric is the formula student team of SAE NIT Kurukshetraâ€”fuelled by a passion for speed, precision, and the art of racing. It's the adrenaline of the first lap, the elegance in engineering, and the challenge of perfecting performance that drive us to design, build, and race formula-style cars for competitions like Formula Bharat and SUPRA SAEINDIA. From making our debut in SUPRA 2014 to emerging as the top-ranking NIT team in SUPRA 2018, our journey has been one of relentless growth and unyielding spirit. As Felipe Massa once said, \"When you give up your hunger for success, you are not racing full-heartedly anymore.\" And hunger is something we never run out of."
